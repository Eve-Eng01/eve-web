                Introduction
                <span class="time-indicator">2 min.</span>
            </h2>
            <p>How many of us have experienced the frustration of giving someone important instructions, only to discover they weren't really listening? Perhaps you've asked a family member to pick up some food stuff from the market, carefully explaining what they should buy, only to have them return with completely different itemsâ€”or nothing at all.</p>
            <p>In today's information age, we're constantly bombarded with messages. News, advertisements, social mediaâ€”it's easy to develop "selective hearing." But when it comes to God's Word, the stakes are much higher than forgotten food stuff. Our eternal future depends on not just hearing, but truly listening to and acting upon what Jehovah teaches us.</p>
            <p>Today we'll examine why Jesus repeatedly emphasized the importance of listening, and more importantly, how we can become effective doers of God's Word.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">
                "Let the One Who Has Ears Listen"
                <span class="time-indicator">6 min.</span>
            </h2>
            
            <h3 class="subsection-title">The Urgency of Jesus' Appeal</h3>
            <p>Jesus wasn't speaking to people with hearing impairments when he repeatedly said, "Let the one who has ears listen." In Matthew alone, we find this appeal three times (Matthew 11:15; 13:9, 43). He was addressing those who possessed the physical ability to hear but might lack the spiritual desire to truly listen.</p>
            <p>Picture Jesus standing before crowds of thousands. His voice carries across the hillside as he teaches profound truths about God's Kingdom. Yet he knows that while many are hearing his words, only a few are truly listeningâ€”allowing his message to penetrate their hearts and change their lives.</p>
            
            <div class="scripture-quote">
                <span class="scripture-reference-inline">[Read Matthew 15:10]</span> "With that he called the crowd near and said to them: 'Listen and get the sense of it.'"
            </div>
            
            <p>Notice that Jesus didn't just say "listen"â€”he said "listen and get the sense of it." True listening involves understanding, contemplation, and a willingness to be changed by what we hear.</p>
            
            <h3 class="subsection-title">Why Many Fail to Listen</h3>
            <p>Today, just as in Jesus' time, millions have heard at least portions of the Bible's message. Yet relatively few pay genuine attention. What prevents people from truly listening to God's Word?</p>
            <p>Some are hindered by prejudicesâ€”preconceived notions about religion or the Bible that prevent them from considering its message with an open mind. Others are distracted by human philosophies that seem more appealing than God's standards. Still others are simply too busy with the distractions of daily life to give serious thought to spiritual matters.</p>
            
            <h3 class="subsection-title">The Vital Importance of Listening</h3>
            <p>Why is humble listening to God's Word so crucial?</p>
            
            <div class="scripture-quote">
                <span class="scripture-reference-inline">[Read John 17:3]</span> "This means everlasting life, their coming to know you, the only true God, and the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ."
            </div>
            
            <p>Salvation itself depends on gaining accurate knowledge of Jehovah God and Jesus Christ.</p>
            
            <div class="scripture-quote">
                <span class="scripture-reference-inline">[Read Romans 10:17]</span> "So faith follows the thing heard. In turn, what is heard is through the word about Christ."
            </div>
            
            <p>Faithâ€”essential for salvationâ€”comes through hearing God's Word. But notice that Paul doesn't say faith comes from merely hearing words, but from hearing "the word about Christ"â€”the specific message God wants us to understand.</p>
            
            <div class="scripture-quote">
                <span class="scripture-reference-inline">[Read Matthew 4:4]</span> Jesus himself emphasized our dependence on God's Word: "Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every word that comes from Jehovah's mouth."
            </div>
            
            <p>Just as our physical bodies require daily nourishment, our spiritual lives depend on regularly taking in God's Word.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">
                Hearers Must Also Become Doers of the Word
                <span class="time-indicator">7 min.</span>
            </h2>
            
            <h3 class="subsection-title">Knowledge Alone Is Insufficient</h3>
            <p>Many people pride themselves on their Bible knowledge. They can quote scriptures, explain doctrines, and engage in theological discussions. Yet the Bible warns us that knowledge alone is insufficient for salvation.</p>
            
            <div class="scripture-quote">
                <span class="scripture-reference-inline">[Read James 1:25]</span> "But the one who peers into the perfect law that belongs to freedom and continues in it has become, not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work; and he will be happy in what he does."
            </div>
            
            <p>The apostle James uses a powerful illustration in the verses preceding this. He compares a person who hears God's Word but doesn't act on it to someone who looks in a mirror, sees their reflection, then immediately forgets what they look like. What good does the mirror serve if the person doesn't act on what they see?</p>
            
            <h3 class="subsection-title">The Power to Change</h3>
            <p>Some may feel that making significant changes in their lives is impossible, especially when dealing with deeply entrenched habits or practices. The Bible acknowledges this challenge but also provides hope.</p>
            
            <div class="scripture-quote">
                <span class="scripture-reference-inline">[Read 1 Corinthians 6:9-11]</span> Paul lists serious sins including sexual immorality, theft, and drunkenness, then makes this remarkable statement: "And yet that is what some of you were. But you have been washed clean; you have been sanctified; you have been declared righteous in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and with the spirit of our God."
            </div>
            
            <p>Notice the past tense: "that is what some of you were." With God's help through his holy spirit, people can overcome even the most challenging behaviors and practices.</p>
            
            <div class="quote-attribution">
                The Watchtower of April 15, 2010, explains: "Some who become true Christians formerly engaged in such immoral practices as fornication, adultery, and homosexuality. The desires that give birth to sinful acts can be deeply entrenched. Yet, such individuals have been 'washed clean,' indicating that they have made the changes in their life needed to please God. What enables a lover of God to resist successfully the impulse to act on wrong desires? 'The spirit of our God,' says 1 Corinthians 6:11."
            </div>
            
            <h3 class="subsection-title">Motivation for Change</h3>
            <p>What motivates someone to make difficult changes?</p>
            
            <div class="scripture-quote">
                <span class="scripture-reference-inline">[Read Isaiah 48:17, 18]</span> "This is what Jehovah says, your Repurchaser, the Holy One of Israel: 'I, Jehovah, am your God, The One teaching you to benefit yourself, The One guiding you in the way you should walk. If only you would pay attention to my commandments! Then your peace would become just like a river And your righteousness like the waves of the sea.'"
            </div>
            
            <p>Jehovah doesn't ask us to change simply to make our lives more difficult. He teaches us "to benefit" ourselves. When we follow his guidance, we experience peace like a flowing river and righteousness as abundant as ocean waves.</p>
            
            <h3 class="subsection-title">Not Just Any Good Works</h3>
            <p>Some might argue, "I'm a good person. I help others, donate to charity, and try to live morally. Isn't that enough?" Jesus addressed this very attitude.</p>
            
            <div class="scripture-quote">
                <span class="scripture-reference-inline">[Read Matthew 7:21-23]</span> "Not everyone saying to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter into the Kingdom of the heavens, but only the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will. Many will say to me in that day: 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons in your name, and perform many powerful works in your name?' And then I will declare to them: 'I never knew you! Get away from me, you workers of lawlessness!'"
            </div>
            
            <p>The <span class="emphasis">Come Follow Me</span> book provides a helpful illustration: Imagine parents who hire a babysitter with simple instructions: "Take care of our children. Feed them, make sure they are clean, and keep them from harm." When they return, they find their children hungry, dirty, and crying while the babysitter is washing windows. When questioned, she proudly points to her work: "Look at all I did! The windows are spotless!"</p>
            <p>The parents would be furious. They never asked her to wash windowsâ€”they wanted their children cared for. Similarly, God isn't impressed with good works that ignore his specific instructions about what he wants us to do.</p>

            <p>What work did Jesus prioritize during his earthly ministry?</p>
            
            <div class="scripture-quote">
                <span class="scripture-reference-inline">[Read John 18:37]</span> When questioned by Pilate, Jesus declared: "For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is on the side of the truth listens to my voice."
            </div>
            
            <p>Jesus came to bear witness to the truthâ€”to teach and proclaim God's message.</p>
            
            <div class="scripture-quote">
                <span class="scripture-reference-inline">[Read Luke 4:18-21]</span> In the synagogue at Nazareth, he applied Isaiah's prophecy to himself: "Jehovah's spirit is upon me, because he anointed me to declare good news to the poor. He sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and a recovery of sight to the blind, to send the crushed ones away free, to preach Jehovah's acceptable year."
            </div>
            
            <h3 class="subsection-title">A Life of Teaching and Preaching</h3>
            <div class="scripture-quote">
                <span class="scripture-reference-inline">[Read Matthew 9:35-38]</span> "And Jesus set out on a tour of all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the Kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity. On seeing the crowds, he felt pity for them, because they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples: 'Yes, the harvest is great, but the workers are few. Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.'"
            </div>
            
            <p>Jesus didn't limit his ministry to a single location. He toured cities and villages, consistently teaching and preaching. His compassion for people motivated him to seek more workers for the spiritual harvest.</p>
            
            <h3 class="subsection-title">Commissioning His Followers</h3>
            <p>Jesus didn't intend for the preaching work to end with his earthly ministry.</p>
            
            <div class="scripture-quote">
                <span class="scripture-reference-inline">[Read Matthew 10:5-7]</span> He sent out his twelve apostles with clear instructions: "Do not go off into the road of the nations, and do not enter any Samaritan city; but instead, go continually to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. As you go, preach, saying: 'The Kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.'"
            </div>

            <p>The early Christians took this commission seriously.</p>
            
            <div class="scripture-quote">
                <span class="scripture-reference-inline">[Read Acts 28:30, 31]</span> Even while under house arrest in Rome, Paul continued "preaching the Kingdom of God to them and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with the greatest freeness of speech, without hindrance."

            <div class="scripture-quote">
                <span class="scripture-reference-inline">[Read Acts 1:8]</span> Jesus had promised: "You will be witnesses of me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the most distant part of the earth."
            </div>
            
            <div class="quote-attribution">
                The Insight book notes: "Ten days later, at Pentecost, holy spirit came upon about 120 disciples waiting in Jerusalem, and they proceeded to speak 'about the magnificent things of God.' On that same day, about 3,000 were baptized. Within a short time, the disciples 'filled Jerusalem with their teaching.' With what result? 'The number of the disciples kept multiplying in Jerusalem very much.'"

            <h3 class="subsection-title">The Parable of the Soils</h3>
            <p>Jesus explained why some respond to the Kingdom message while others don't.</p>
            
            <div class="scripture-quote">
                <span class="scripture-reference-inline">[Read Matthew 13:18-23]</span> In his parable of the sower, he described four types of soil representing different responses to God's Word. Those represented by the "fine soil" are described as hearing the word, getting the sense of it, and bearing fruitâ€”producing 30, 60, or even 100 times more.
            </div>
            
            <p>What does it mean to "bear fruit"? Those who truly understand the Kingdom message don't keep it to themselves. They become Kingdom proclaimers, sharing the good news with others.</p>

            <div class="scripture-quote">
                <span class="scripture-reference-inline">[Read Romans 10:13-15]</span> Paul emphasizes the vital role of preachers: "For 'everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.' However, how will they call on him if they have not put faith in him? How, in turn, will they put faith in him about whom they have not heard? How, in turn, will they hear without someone to preach? How, in turn, will they preach unless they have been sent out? Just as it is written: 'How beautiful are the feet of those who declare good news of good things!'"

            <div class="quote-attribution">
                The Kingdom Rules book explains: "Since John's vision shows Jesus wearing a crown, his appointment as King in 1914 had already taken place. The harvest season and the conclusion of this system of things began at the same timeâ€”in 1914. Looking back from our vantage point in time, we can see that the harvest began some years after Jesus started ruling as King... in 1919, 'the harvest of the earth' began."
            </div>
            
            <p>This global harvest work is more urgent than ever before. The angel's words emphasize this urgency: "the hour has come to reap, for the harvest of the earth is fully ripe."</p>

            </div>

            <p>But simply being aware of these events isn't enough. Jesus repeatedly emphasized the need to listenâ€”to really listenâ€”to God's Word. And once we've heard and understood, we must act. We must become doers of the Word, not hearers only.</p>
            
            <p>The choice before each of us is clear. We can continue on the broad road that leads to destruction, or we can choose the narrow gate that leads to life. We can be like the person who glances in a mirror and immediately forgets what they look like, or we can be like the wise man who builds his house upon the rock.</p>
            
            <p>May all of us resolve to be both hearers and doers of God's Word. As we do so, we'll experience Jehovah's rich blessings now and have the wonderful hope of life everlasting in his righteous new world.</p>
